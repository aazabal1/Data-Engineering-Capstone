The project follows the follow steps:
* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data

* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up

The submission consists of three main files.
    Capstone_Project_Steps_1_2.ipynb - This contains the analysis done for steps 1 and 2 
    Capstone_Project_Steps_3_4_5.ipynb - This contains the analysis done for steps 3, 4 and 5. This code is self-contained, so steps 1 and 2 are not necessary to complete this code.
    Data Dictionary.txt - This contains the data dictionary of the data model used for this project
    
The rest of the files are as follows:
    The .csv files contain either snapshots of the large datasets used in the project of are datasets created during the data wrangling process
    I94_SAS_Labels_Descriptions.SAS contains descriptions of all of the inmigration database
    The sas_ folder contains the input inmigration data
    The dim_ and fact_ folders contain the output data from the ETL pipeline
